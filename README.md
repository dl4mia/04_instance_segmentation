### Instance Segmentation with StarDist 

In this tutorial, we shall learn to use *StarDist* to train a model for **2D** and **3D** instance segmentation on microscopy images.

See **[this](https://carbonated-tub-0d7.notion.site/Instance-Segmentation-with-StarDist-and-Cellpose-DL4MIA-22-2ec6d85d79904be6964f5ecf76e4f50a)** document for installing the environments and running the included exercises.
